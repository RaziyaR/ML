**Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning**

Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model to determine car prices based on various features. A Chinese automobile company planning to enter the US market has commissioned an automobile consulting firm to analyze the factors affecting car pricing. Using machine learning regression models, this project provides insights into price determinants and helps the company strategize product designs and business operations.

Dataset

The dataset consists of various car attributes, including engine specifications, body type, mileage, and other critical factors influencing pricing. The data has been preprocessed and used for model training and evaluation.

Key Steps in the Project

1.Data Loading and Preprocessing:

2.Handled missing values and outliers

3.Encoded categorical variables

4.Scaled numerical features where necessary

Model Implementation:

Trained the following regression models:

1.Linear Regression

2.Decision Tree Regressor

3.Random Forest Regressor

4.Gradient Boosting Regressor

5.Support Vector Regressor


Model Evaluation:

Compared models based on RÂ², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Identified the best-performing model


Feature Importance Analysis:

Identified key variables that significantly impact car prices


Hyperparameter Tuning:

Optimized model performance using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV


Conclusion

The project successfully implemented and evaluated multiple regression models to predict car prices. The analysis showed that ensemble models like Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor outperformed others in terms of accuracy and error metrics. Feature importance analysis provided valuable insights into the most influential factors affecting car pricing, helping the company understand the market dynamics better. Hyperparameter tuning further improved model performance, making the predictions more reliable.

This model can assist the company in making data-driven decisions regarding car manufacturing, pricing strategies, and feature optimization to ensure competitive positioning in the US market.
